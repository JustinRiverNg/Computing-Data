Note: Although, hot fudge pairs well with ice cream and ice cream is generally eaten in the summer time, this recipe is delicious at any time of the year. Hot fudge is also extremely delicious with brownies, cookies, pie, and even fruits.

Also note: Brown sugar can be replaced for regular sugar. Also, sugar amount can be adjusted as desired.

### Quadratic Equation

A quadratic equation is any equation with the form equation: *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

Note:

-   a is the coefficient in front of the x^2
-   b is the coefficient in front of the x

To solve the quadratic equation for x, use the following formula:

$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

The derivation of the solution is as follows:

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*

4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*

(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*

$2ax + b = \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 -4ac}$

$2ax = -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 -4ac}$

$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

###### Comments and Reflections

-   Although my GSI mentioned LaTeX in class, I wasn't sure what he was referring to. On the third part of this homework, I figured it out as I looked up how to put exponents, square roots, and plus/minus into R.
-   Easy parts of this assignment that we didn't really go over in class included images because all you need is a simple input, which was shown on the cheatsheet.
-   Yes, this was my first time using markdown. I enjoy it because it's limitless.
-   I didn't need help on the assignment. I just looked up specific parts on Google if I didn't know the notation for certain things.
-   It took me a couple of hours to complete this HW.
-   The most time consuming part of this assignment was the research itself.
